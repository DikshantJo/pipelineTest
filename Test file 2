4. Ensure Your Plugin is Properly Integrated with Jenkins' Global Configuration:
After implementing the above changes, make sure that:

The API key, email username, and password values should persist after saving.

When you push the code (or do any operation), Jenkins should correctly reference these persisted configuration values and not overwrite or lose them.
